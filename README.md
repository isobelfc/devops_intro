# DevOps

## Before DevOps
- Development would develop, then pass to operations
- When operations encountered errors, they would have to pass back to Development
- Little communication between the teams

## Infrastructure Revolution
- Growth of cloud computing
- Allows scaling on demand

### Application Design Patterns
- Monolith vs N-tier vs Microservice
- Monolith: everything in the same place, with no backup. Use for very small projects.
- N-tier: seperate front and back end
- Microservices: lots of different teams

- Waterfall: each stage of development takes place in sequence. Hard to track back when finding errors at late stages, dependencies right the way to the end
- Agile: iterations, meaning no dependencies

## DevOps Basics
- Reduces time to market by an estimated 50%
- Collaboration of Development and Operations
- A culture which promotes collaboration between Dev and Ops team to deploy code to production faster in an automated and repeatable way. Culture - the company as a whole needs to understand importance
- Practice of development and operation engineers taking part together in the whole service lifecycle
- Approach through which superior quality software can be developed quickly and with more reliability
- Alignment of development and IT operations with better communication and collaboration
- Shortens times but keeps high quality

### Principles
- Customer-centric action
- End-to-end responsibility
- Continuous improvement
- Automate everything
- Work as one team
- Monitor and test everything

### Stages in Lifecycle
- Continuous development
- Continuous testing
- Continuous integration
- Continuous deployment
- Continuous monitoring

### Tools
- Ansible
- Chef
- Git
- Jenkins
- Bamboo
- AWS
- Many others

### Implementations
- Infrastructure as Code
- Infrastructure as a Service
- Infrastructure as a Platform
- Infrastructure as a Product

### Risk register
- Chance of occurence of events, the potential damage and the risk

### Tasks of DevOps engineer
- Soft skills
- Sysadmin
- Deploy virtualisation
- Hands-on experience in network and storage
- Knowledge of coding
- Understanding the automation tools
- Knowledge of testing
